# Aim-Trainer
This is my first game made with lua and the LOVE framework I really enjoyed making this so I will keep making projects with LOVE

# How to build game
So first you have to install visual studio code: https://code.visualstudio.com
and then download the Love2D support extension

then you have to download LOVE: https://love2d.org
and then when you did all of that you have to put the lovetest file somewhere (preferably on your desktop)
then open the main.lua file in visual studio code.
Then when you open it press alt + L to open your game.
or another way to open it is to just drag the lovetest file into love.exe

if you couldent follow the instructtion heres the video on how to do it: Video not up yet


# Thanks
Thank you for downloading the game and I hope your aim will get better by playing this
I may update the game in the future to have a main menu etc
